# Sentiment_Analysis
This is the base program for the comparative analysis of the GPT and Gemini models in sentiment analysis, created as part of my master's thesis.

Sentiment Analysis using GPT and Gemini
This repository contains a comparative analysis of two large language models — GPT and Gemini — applied to a sentiment analysis task. The project includes data preprocessing, model implementation via API, performance evaluation using key metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), and visualization of results.
